## Addon-Usage

Displays addon memory/cpu usage. 3.3.5a backport of version 2.0.2 of this addon: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/addon-usage
Use it with ```/addonusage``` or ```/usage```


## Important: 
CPU monitoring causes overhead that will affect performance while it is enabled. Remember to turn it off when done testing. (It will set ```CVar_scriptProfile``` to ```1```).
